### Saving

When saving, level channels and roles are updated on discord.

The channels of changes levels are moved to their categories (if the level has both a channel and a category with a discord category).

For each linked channel, everyone is denied read permission with an exception for the roles of the level and its child levels.

If a level has a parent level every user that has reached that level is immediately given its role.


## Functions

### Bot interactions

The bot provides two user commands `solve` and `unlock`. `Solve` marks a reached level as solved when provided with a correct solution, `unlock` marks a secret level as reached so it can be solved later.

A level is *reached* if either all of its parent levels are solved and it does not have an unlock or it has been unlocked.

### Solving a level
Users can solve a level by calling the solve command with one of its solutions while the level is *reached*.
If the level has an extra role set, the role is replaced by the extra role for the user.
The user is also given the roles of all levels that become *reached* by solving.
If a level with no unlocks becomes reached, the roles (not extra roles) of all its parent levels are removed from the user.
> Note: If the parent level has no role set, it iterates up to its parent levels until it finds a role to remove.


### Unlocking a level
Users can unlock a level by calling the unlock command with one of its unlocks when all its parent levels have been reached.
If the level has a role set, that role is given to the user.
